<h2>🚨 Problem</h2>

College students currently rely on <strong>fragmented and inefficient systems</strong> to access academic information, report grievances, and seek mental health support. These systems often require <strong>physical visits to multiple offices</strong>, lack <strong>anonymity</strong>, and involve <strong>long response times</strong>.

As a result, students face:

- Unnecessary stress and wasted time  
- Fear of judgment or repercussions while raising concerns  
- Lack of clarity around mental health support  
- Delayed or unresolved academic and administrative issues  

<p>
Many students silently endure genuine academic, administrative, and psychological challenges, negatively affecting their well-being, academic performance, and overall campus experience.
